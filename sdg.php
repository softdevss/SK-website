      <span>End extreme poverty in all forms by 2030. Yes, it’s ambitious goal-but we believe it can be done. In 2000, the world committed to cutting the number of people living in extreme poverty by half in 15 years and we met this goal. However, more than 800 million people around the world still live on less than $1.25 a day-that’s about the equivalent of the entire population of Europe living in extreme poverty. Now it’s time to build on what we learned and end poverty altogether.</span>

      <span>In the past 20 years, hunger has dropped by almost half. Many countries that used to suffer from famine and hunger can now meet the nutritional needs of their most vulnerable people. It’s an incredible accomplishment. Now we can go further and end hunger and malnutrition once for all. That means doing things such as promoting sustainable agriculture and supporting small farmers. It’s a tall order; but for the sake of the nearly 1 out of every 9 people on earth who go to bed hungry every night, we have to try. Imagine a world where everyone has access to sufficient and nutritious food all year round. Together, we can make that a reality by 2030.</span>

That’s why there’s a Goal to make sure everyone has health coverage and access to safe and effective medicines and vaccines. Since 1990, we’ve made big strides-preventable child deaths are down by more than half, and maternal mortality is down by almost as much. However, some other numbers remain tragically high, like the fact that every year 6 million children die before their fifth birthday or that AIDS related illness are the leading cause of death for adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa.

Since 2000, there has been enormous progress on the goal to provide primary education to all children worldwide. The primary school enrollment rate in developing regions reached 91%.

More girls are in school now compared to in 2000. Most regions have reached gender parity in primary education. The percentage of women getting paid for their work is on the rise. the Sustainable Development Goals aim to build on these achievements to ensure that there is an end to discrimination against women and girls everywhere.
