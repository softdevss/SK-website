      <span>End extreme poverty in all forms by 2030. Yes, it’s ambitious goal-but we believe it can be done. In 2000, the world committed to cutting the number of people living in extreme poverty by half in 15 years and we met this goal. However, more than 800 million people around the world still live on less than $1.25 a day-that’s about the equivalent of the entire population of Europe living in extreme poverty. Now it’s time to build on what we learned and end poverty altogether.</span>

      <h2>END HUNGER, ACHIEVE FOOD SECURITY AND IMPROVED NUTRITION, AND PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</h2>
      <span>In the past 20 years, hunger has dropped by almost half. Many countries that used to suffer from famine and hunger can now meet the nutritional needs of their most vulnerable people. It’s an incredible accomplishment. Now we can go further and end hunger and malnutrition once for all. That means doing things such as promoting sustainable agriculture and supporting small farmers. It’s a tall order; but for the sake of the nearly 1 out of every 9 people on earth who go to bed hungry every night, we have to try. Imagine a world where everyone has access to sufficient and nutritious food all year round. Together, we can make that a reality by 2030.</span>

      <span>We all know how important it is to be in good health. Our health affects everything from how much we enjoy life to what work we can perform. That’s why there’s a Goal to make sure everyone has health coverage and access to safe and effective medicines and vaccines. Since 1990, we’ve made big strides-preventable child deaths are down by more than half, and maternal mortality is down by almost as much. However, some other numbers remain tragically high, like the fact that every year 6 million children die before their fifth birthday or that AIDS related illness are the leading cause of death for adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. We have the means to turn that around and make good health more than just a wish.</span>

In fact, in developing regions, children from the poorest households are four times more likely to be out of school than those of the richest households. Now for some good news. Since 2000, there has been enormous progress on the goal to provide primary education to all children worldwide. The primary school enrollment rate in developing regions reached 91%. By measures in any school, that’s a good grade. </span>
